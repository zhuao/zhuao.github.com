I just saw an amazing little video on the [Crazyflie Nano Quadcopter](http://www.bitcraze.se/2013/02/pre-order-has-started/). This thing is so cool! I am going to try to talk the wife into getting one. One of the neatest things is that they are [open source](http://bitcraze.bitbucket.org/) and moddable so you can change it's mechanics and software to what you want.

I'm curious if you could control it with a Raspberry Pi to increase mobility. Or even have two of them carry a Raspberry Pi with a pre-programmed route and do some long range reconnaissance missions. 

Oh and here's a video.
