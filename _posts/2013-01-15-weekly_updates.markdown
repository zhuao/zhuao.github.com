Hey folks,

I just wanted to throw out that I've got a goal of doing weekly updates of this blog. Lets call it a new years resolution. I've always wanted to think that I was the type of person who would keep a blog, and hopefully by doing weekly posts I can be the type who doesn't abandon the blog after 4 posts. So there's the goal. 

This blog's Jenkins server is currently set to put up the newest post at 7am on Friday's. So happy new years and here's to a year of weekly blogging coverage!
