I'm excited to get this blog thingie started. I'll be collecting a few of the tidbits that I've learned over time here. And migrating my little bit of content on [Tumblr](http://rbirnie.tumblr.com/) over here.

My main goal of this blog is more of the under-pinnings though, I plan on testing a few different deployment methods on the site to see what works and what doesn't. From there I hope to share with you folks (\*hears crickets\*)...ahem... my experiences.

A huge thanks goes out to [Joe Fiorini](http://www.userobsessed.net/) for the initial version of the blog. I don't want to be too big of a pirate so I'll eventually move away to my own design but his awesome job sure made it much easier to get up and going.
