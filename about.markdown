<p>I'm an IT professional, Systems Engineer and budding entrepreneur. I work for <a href="http://us.etrade.com">E*Trade</a>, I love automating things and dream of the day when deploying code is so simple that we never have to login to a Linux box.</p>

<p>I'm also a book worm, traveler, scuba diver, sailor, aquarist, horticulturist, foodie, husband, and father. If only there was more time in the world... If you really want to know more about me then check out my <a href="http://about.me/robert.birnie">about.me</a> for a list of other places I commonly lurk.</p>
